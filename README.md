1. Download the files or clone the repository to your computer
2. Open the project folder in your code editor of choice
3. No special tooling is required to preview the site when developing. You can either open the index.html file directly, or use any tool to start a develop server which serves the index.html for
  - for example, in VScode, open the command palette and search for `live server: open with live server`

- `Site is successfully deployed to GitHub pages.`
- `Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.`
- `Required content was in place by the deadline.`
- `Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology.`
